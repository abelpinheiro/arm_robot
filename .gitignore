# ROS 2 specific
# Generated messages, services, and actions
# These are typically generated in the install/ share/ folders
# but can also appear in source directories during development
# Depending on your build system and setup, you might need to adjust these.
# For example, if you are using ament_cmake_auto, these might be in build/
# or install/ directories, which are already ignored.
# However, if you have specific cases where generated files appear in source,
# you might need to add more specific rules.
# For example:
# msg/
# srv/
# action/
